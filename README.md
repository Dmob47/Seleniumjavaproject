I created a Selenium project (main/java/FinalProject.java) using IntelliJ on the Tutorial Ninja demo website, automating the entire process of logging in, adding items to the shopping cart, and finally checking out. Additionally, there are some other practice modules under java/org/example/tests.
New Automation Project where i use java and selenium to Automate the process of visiting ignou admission status website, entering the student enrollment no. and selecting the Program code. We cant automate the whole process though because we have to enter the verification code which is a dynamic value and can't be predicted also its not a good practice to automate a CAPCHA.
